  <h1>Create a Custom AI-Powered Chatbot for Your Private Data</h1>

    <p><strong>Profile Description:</strong></p>
    <p>In a world where everyone talks about AI, I’m here to offer you something that actually makes sense: a custom AI solution that lets you query your own private data. Think of it as your personal data concierge—no mystery, no sci-fi promises, just real insights from your data, served up through a friendly chat interface.</p>

    <h2>Here’s what I’ll help you achieve:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Let's take a look under the hood. I’ll give you guidance on how to format and polish up your data so it's ready for the chatbot’s curious questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Database Selection:</strong> Don’t worry about “vector what now?” I’ll guide you on choosing the perfect database to store and retrieve data with ease (and minimal headaches).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Uploading:</strong> Relax—I’ll walk you through uploading your data into the chosen database so seamlessly, you might actually enjoy it!</li>
        <li><strong>LLM Selection:</strong> Picking the right Large Language Model is like picking the perfect cup of coffee: let’s find the one that’s just right for your needs, budget, and taste for accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Chat Interface:</strong> Your data, your rules. Ask questions in plain language, and get straight answers instead of a wild goose chase through files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>Starting at around $650 (not written in stone), with pricing adjustments based on the size and state of your data. Cost will be lower if we are only uploading PDF documents. We’ll start with a prototype and, when you’re happy, I can help you host it. Yes, you’ll own it—no AI middlemen here!</p>

    <h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
    <p>Currently working with Fortune 500 companies on similar projects (yep, the big guys trust me), I bring solid, real-world experience in creating custom AI solutions that work. Let’s bring that power to your data, turning it from “where did I put that file?” to “wow, that was easy!”</p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Busy Executives:</strong> For those who have been meaning to get up to speed on AI but keep putting it off—consider this your fast-track to AI magic.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Owners:</strong> Got a user manual, cookbook, repair guide, or catalog gathering dust? Let’s make it query-ready with a friendly chat interface, so your users don’t have to search for every answer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Ready to unlock the secrets in your own data? Let’s make it happen with a smile (and maybe a few laughs) along the way!</p>
