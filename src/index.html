  <h1>Create a Custom AI-Powered Chatbot for Your Private Data</h1>
<p>In a world where everyone talks about AI, I&rsquo;m here to offer you something that actually makes sense: a custom AI solution that lets you query your own private data. Think of it as your personal data concierge&mdash;no mystery, no sci-fi promises, just real insights from your data, served up through a friendly chat interface.</p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll help you achieve:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Let's take a look under the hood. I&rsquo;ll give you guidance on how to format and polish up your data so it's ready for the chatbot&rsquo;s curious questions.</li>
<li><strong>Vector Database Selection:</strong> Don&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;vector what now?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll guide you on choosing the perfect database to store and retrieve data with ease (and minimal headaches).</li>
<li><strong>Data Uploading:</strong> Relax&mdash;I&rsquo;ll walk you through uploading your data into the chosen database so seamlessly, you might actually enjoy it!</li>
<li><strong>LLM Selection:</strong> Picking the right Large Language Model is like picking the perfect cup of coffee: let&rsquo;s find the one that&rsquo;s just right for your needs, budget, and taste for accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Chat Interface:</strong> Your data, your rules. Ask questions in plain language, and get straight answers instead of a wild goose chase through files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Starting at around $650 (not written in stone), with pricing adjustments based on the size and state of your data. Cost will be lower if we are only uploading PDF documents. We&rsquo;ll start with a prototype and, when you&rsquo;re happy, I can help you host it. Yes, you&rsquo;ll own it&mdash;no AI middlemen here!</p>
<h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
<p>Currently working with Fortune 500 companies on similar projects (yep, the big guys trust me), I bring solid, real-world experience in creating custom AI solutions that work. Let&rsquo;s bring that power to your data, turning it from &ldquo;where did I put that file?&rdquo; to &ldquo;wow, that was easy!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Busy Executives:</strong> For those who have been meaning to get up to speed on AI but keep putting it off&mdash;consider this your fast-track to AI magic.</li>
<li><strong>Business Owners:</strong> Got a user manual, repair guide, or catalogs gathering dust? Let&rsquo;s make it query-ready with a friendly chat interface, so your users don&rsquo;t have to search for every answer.</li>
 <li><strong>Individuals:</strong> Do you have a project to collect recipes in a cookbook, or create a self-help guide, or may be assemble some handwritten letters that will be forgotten? Let&rsquo;s see how we can advance your project and query the results in a  fun way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to unlock the secrets in your own data? Let&rsquo;s make it happen with a smile (and maybe a few laughs) along the way!</p>
